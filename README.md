# Meme with CSS
Welcome to the Meme with CSS project! This project demonstrates how to create a meme using only CSS with no JavaScript or external libraries involved. The goal is to creatively display a humorous image entirely through the power of CSS, leveraging custom shapes, backgrounds, and typography to deliver the meme.
## Features
- Pure CSS meme creation without the use of images or JavaScript.
- Responsive design to ensure that the meme is viewable on various screen sizes.

## How it Works 
The meme is built using only CSS properties, such as:

- Backgrounds: Leveraging CSS background images, gradients, or colors to set the meme's backdrop.
- Typography: Using CSS to stylize the meme's text with custom fonts, sizes, and positions.
- Positioning: Flexbox or CSS Grid for precise positioning of elements.
- Shapes: CSS borders and pseudo-elements to create shapes like speech bubbles or character outlines.
